## 2) About
- Use JupyterLite, a JupyterLab distribution that runs entirely in the browser, to provide a lightweight and portable environment for teaching numerical modeling, together with [NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org/) and [ngcotree](https://github.com/radu-bogdan/ngcotree)
- Based on the following template repository : [https://github.com/NGSolve/jupyterlite_ngsolve/tree/main](https://github.com/NGSolve/jupyterlite_ngsolve/tree/main). Thanks a lot to the developers !
- Developed by T. Cherrière, T. Gauthey & A. El Gode (CentraleSupélec, GeePs laboratory, France). Thanks also to B. Radu (ngcotree), M. Hage-Hassan & A. Cesarano who contributed in previous versions of this tutorial.
