## 2) About
- Use JupyterLite, a JupyterLab distribution that runs entirely in the browser, to provide a lightweight and portable environment for teaching numerical modeling, together with [NGSolve](https://ngsolve.org/) and [ngcotree](https://github.com/radu-bogdan/ngcotree)
- Based on the following template repository : [https://github.com/NGSolve/jupyterlite_ngsolve/tree/main](https://github.com/NGSolve/jupyterlite_ngsolve/tree/main). Thanks a lot to the developers !
